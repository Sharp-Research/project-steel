# Project-Steel

Project Steel is an exercise calorie tracker. The main landing page will have an area to input basic information about the user. This will be items like name, weight, time, and exercise. There will be an area for the user to input their workouts which will calculate the calories burned. On a different page of the website will be a graph which displays the recorded calories burned and track the progress. This will help the user track their workout progress and track the intensity of their workouts.

The contributors to this project are as follows: Stephanie Hill, Dennis DeVries, Jamall Malik, Marvin Bonds, Rui Guo.
