# Project Steel Plan

Names: Stephanie Hill, Dennis DeVries, Jamall Malik, Marvin Bonds, Rui Guo

## Cooperation Plan

Strengths:

- Dennis: JS algorithms
- Stephanie: Amazing at CSS
- Jamall: HTML structuring
- Marvin: JS problem solving
- Rui: good at all three: CSS, HTML, and JS

We can use these strengths to create perfect coding pairs and better distribute our talents.

We plan to approach our day-to-day work by having scheduled group meetings and dividing our tasks into smaller teams to work on.

## Conflict Plan

When conflict arrises we will put things to a vote in order to take out the guess work. We are going to create a free and open group environment and encourage participation. If one person begins to take over we will remind each other that our project is a group effort. We can take a short break in order to ground everyone again. When challenges and differences rise we will be positive and straight forward. Don't let things go unsaid we will encourage an open group enviornment. We emphasize a professional work environment so we will kindly approach the person who is not adequately contributing and address any aspects that could be prohibiting them from their work. We can also reduce the work distribution by breaking into small teams to help hold each other accountable. If resolution attempts are unseccessful during a conflict, we can take a short break and let everyone calm down. If it is a decision we can elevate the problem to the instructor to help solve the issue. 

## Communication Plan

- Hours: The group will be available during regular Code Fellows class time
- Communication platform: Slack group chat, Remo
- Breaks: breaks will handled at the small group level based on need
- After Hours Communication: We will use Slack as our main communication and will set our notification status as 'unavailable' if we don't want to be contacted
- Fall Behind Plan: We will create two plans. One plan to have a more elaborate project pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. The second project will be less intense that we can still execute if we fall behind
- Communication Strategy: We will rotate who speaks in a group setting and alternate tasks to gain more perspective on the project.
- Safe environment: We will treat everyone with diginity and respect. We will encourage communication to increase care and directly challenging the issue.

## Work Plan

Task Assignment: We will make a wireframe and break our project down into tasks that can be broken into small groups

Project Management: Github projects

## Git Process

- Components: we will store the whole project on Github
- Repository Sharing: We will share the project through Github everyone with admin rights
- Git Flow: We will work from a dev branch and have individual branches off of the dev branch
- PR review workflow:
      - We will have two reviewers for Github: Dennis, and Jamall
      - We will merge once a day at the end of the day.
