## Vision

Project Steel creates a website that provides simple workout options and calorie tracking in order to improve personal fitness. We aim to solve the problem of beginners to fitness not knowing what workouts to pick and how it affects them. We will package the data in a pleasing display to help the user stay focused on the workout and not on the website. You should care about our product if you care about your health.

## Scope

- IN:
      - Track user workout data
      - Calculate calories burned
      - Display a calendar layout
      - Visual display of data
- OUT:
      - Will not track more than one user

## Minimum Viable Product

Our MVP is to display the workout/calorie tracker. In addition, we will have the display of the progress and user input.
